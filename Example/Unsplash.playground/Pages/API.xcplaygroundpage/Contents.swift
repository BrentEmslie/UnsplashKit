## Creating the client
The first thing we have to do is create an API client that will execute the resources against the API and return the parsed responses asynchronously.
> UnsplashClient supports passing a closure that returns extra headers to be inserted in a given request. For example, these headers can contain the user authentication in the Authorization header.

## Requests
Models expose the requests that can be executed as resources. A resource contains the request, and how the response should be parsed. For example `User.me` returns the resource to fetch the authenticated user.
