## Creating the client
The first thing we have to do is create an API client that will execute the resources against the API and return the parsed responses asynchronously.
> UnsplashClient supports passing a closure that returns extra headers to be inserted in a given request. For example, these headers can contain the user authentication in the Authorization header.

/*:
## Requests
Models expose the requests that can be executed as resources. A resource contains the request, and how the response should be parsed. For example `User.me` returns the resource to fetch the authenticated user.
*/

//    if let userFirstName = result.value?.object.firstName {
//        print("ðŸ“· User name: \(userFirstName)")
//    }
//}

//: - Fetch authenticated user `User.me`.
//: - Update authenticated user `User.updateMe`.
//: - Get user `User.get`.
//: - Get user portfolio `User.portfolio`.
